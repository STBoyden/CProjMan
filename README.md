# CProjMan - the POSIX-shell-based C/C++ project manager!

This is a simple script, inspired by Rust's Cargo, to help with the creation, complimation and 
running of C/C++ binaries using premake5 as it's build system. The commands are fairly 
self-explanatory and thus, easy to use.

To make the script even more useful, place it somewhere in your distro's PATH environment variable 
so it can be accessed from any point.

## To Do

- [ ] Auto update script
- [x] Display command help on invalid usage.
